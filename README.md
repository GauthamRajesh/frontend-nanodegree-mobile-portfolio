# How to run the website:

1. Download the files.
2. Open index.html in a browser.

# Optimizations to views/pizza.html:

1. Reduced the number of background pizzas.
2. Compressed pizzeria.jpg and profilepic.jpg.
3. Prevented forced reflow by setting up allRandomPizzaContainers, dx and newwidth out of the loop to avoid recalculating layout at every step.
